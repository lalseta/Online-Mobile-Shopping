        TechShop in April 2016, Cpital has grown to become India's leading comparison
        based social shopping portal, the one-stop destination for all shoppers, merchants
        and market enthusiasts
    </p>
    <p>
        To begin with Capital does not sell directly. What it does is it initiates' selling.
        With the sudden upsurge of brands and stores, both online and offline, that claim
        to sell the best of the products at the most reasonable prices the shopper goes
        crazy. What is the assurance that the price offered to him is the best? Normally
        before making a buying decision of an expensive product the consumer does an in
        depth research on the product from various websites which is an extremely tedious
        task. He would often wish a single website that would meet all his buying needs.
        Thus fulfiling this motive is came Capital.com in April 2013.
        <br />
        <br />
        Started as a brainchild of two people Capital has grown to about 60 odd employees
        within a span of 1 year. Not only in terms of employees but the organization has
        grown in other respects too. From nil sellers Capital has grown to 500 stores in
        its portfolio and still counting. And that's not all! There are about 470 brands
        that are associated with Capital which include Indiatimes Shopping, Ferns and Petals,
        Home Shop 18, J J Mehta and the likes. This has all been possible due to the dedicated
        and efficient team of Capitalers who strive all along to get nothing but the best.
        Be it sales, operations, technology or marketing, all teams work in unison with
        each other to reach the top.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thus for Capital we are not specifically looking for people who have all the knowledge
        ,but we are also looking for people who have the 'it' factor. We are looking for
        people who are full of life, are willing to learn and most importantly are willing
        to work as a team.
